# 🚀 Orbital – Distributed Task Orchestration Simulator

Orbital is a front-end simulation of a distributed DAG-based task orchestration engine — inspired by platforms like Airflow, Prefect, and Dagster. It enables users to visualize and simulate the execution of complex workflows (DAGs), monitor task status, and view system metrics in real-time.

> 🌙 Built with React, Recharts, and custom CSS — featuring dark mode, live logging, AI optimization insights, and simulated execution logic.

## ✨ Features

### ✅ DAG Execution Engine
- Simulates task execution with retries and failure rates
- Supports sequential task dependencies (DAG logic)
- Visual DAG viewer with status-aware nodes

### 🧠 AI Insights
- AI-powered optimization suggestions
- Dynamic savings calculations and impact tags
- Actionable UX with feedback on applied recommendations

### 📊 System Monitoring
- Real-time dashboard with:
  - Success rate
  - Average execution time
  - Active worker simulation
  - Execution trends and success rate charts

### 💡 UI & UX
- Light & Dark mode toggle
- Modular tabbed layout: DAGs, Monitoring, AI Insights
- Real-time logs with animated status changes
- Fully responsive (desktop + mobile)
